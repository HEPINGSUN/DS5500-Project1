# Project: Coastal Flooding and Climate Change Impacts in Maine

## Team Members
HepingSun

## Goal/Contribution
The project aims to analyze and visualize the current sea level measurements and future predictions in relation to climate change, specifically for the state of Maine. By comparing existing data on sea level rise and tidal impacts, the project seeks to determine the potential local and regional effects of sea level rise under different climate scenarios. The goal is to support policy adjustments and prepare communities for various sea level rise outcomes.

## Story with Objectives
Greenland is the largest contributor to global sea level rise, with a minimum of 10 inches of rise already locked in due to the destabilization of its ice sheet. However, the impact of this rise will vary globally, creating significant climate justice issues. Many of the regions most affected by rising sea levels are the least responsible for the emissions driving climate change. International efforts are underway, including partnerships with the Climate Vulnerable Forum and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to bring attention to these disparities. 

At the local level in Maine, even small increases in sea level pose significant threats to communities, infrastructure, and the economy. For example, a 1.6 ft rise could flood 67% of the coastal sand built on top of old piers in Casco Bay. The "Maine Won’t Wait" climate action plan recommends planning for 1.5 ft of sea level rise by 2050 and 3.9 ft by 2100, but some experts warn that we should prepare for an 8 ft rise by the end of the century. This project will analyze the relationship between current sea level measurements and future predictions to determine the potential effects on Maine’s coastal regions. The findings will inform the state’s climate adaptation plans, ensuring they are sufficient to mitigate the worst-case scenarios.
